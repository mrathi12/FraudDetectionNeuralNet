This repository contains the code for a feed-forward neural network, with the equations derived and implemented from scratch, and the hyperparameter tuning process also detailed in the IPython Notebook.

The dataset being used is from Kaggle (as mentioned in the IPython Notebook) and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud
